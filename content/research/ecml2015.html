title: Simplifying, Regularizing and Strengthening Sum-Product Network Structure Learning
description: 'Tweaking <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/mlc13.pdf">LearnSPN</a> by limiting the number
of child nodes while splitting, by modeling leaves with Chow-Liu trees
and by blending bagging into sum nodes, in order to improve both network
structure quality and likelihood score.'
